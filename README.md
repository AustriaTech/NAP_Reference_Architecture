The National Body Reference Architecture which defines a framework and guideline which basic implementation are needed for a harmonized national access points.<br>
The architecture contains all harmonised and necessary information which were available from NAPCORE.  

By using a well-known software, Enterprise Architect, and a best fitting toolkit, FRAME, the requirements of an understandable and future proof architecture are ensured. 

The National Access Point Reference Architecture can be used for three different use cases: 
-  First, to create a harmonised National Access Point from scratch by implementing the description of any functional and organisational elements which are needed for an operational harmonised National Access Point from the architecture. <br>
-  Second, to harmonise an existing National Access Points by adopting already existing National Access Point functionalities and processes according to the developed National Access Point Reference Architecture. <br>
-  Third, establish basis for comparison of national body by splitting complex functionalities and processes up. These separated parts can be compared between national bodies. <br>

Due to the ongoing developments in work regarding the harmonisation of the National Access Points, this work describes the first version of the architecture.<br> The status of the National Access Point Reference Architecture is ongoing and the continuous new inputs, e.g. the adoption to the new release ITS directive, from NAPCORE to the architecture will result in updates of the National Body Reference Architecture in 2024.
